## Recommendations / Suggestions to Roofing and insurance business:
#### ● Roofing Industry may charge more for their service in Hawaii state as the transportation and higher goods storage cost and many miscellaneous costs to the company due to very high living costs in Hawaii.
#### ● Insurance companies may restructure thier insurance plans to West region as Home Value Index is the highest in WEST and this region has higher commercial places which usually has parapet roofs resulting in higher cost and maintainance thus justifying higher insurance packages.
#### ● Roofing industry can attain more customers in Mid West region by giving competitive price plans to attract more potential customers and even has lesser transportation and storage hassles as their physical network is strong in this region.
#### ● Roofing and Insurance both stakeholders can attain more revenue by restructuring thier plans in coastal areas where the roofs are generally similar designs and less roof area, so are not very complex to build and maintain and hence can cache in with the same reasons as they have higher margins.

This case study on house valuation prices only scratched the surface of a complex topic. I along with a team had done a detailed project and dugged deeper into the factors that influence house prices, such as location, Roof area by categorizing into Tiers, and Roofing Type etc.
Our research team had compiled a vast array of data from various sources, including real estate agencies, government reports, and academic studies. We have analyzed this data using advanced statistical methods and visualization tools to provide insights that are both accurate and engaging. Whether you are a roofing agency, roofing insurance company, real estate agent, or simply curious about the housing market, these slides will broaden your knowledge and challenge your assumptions. I can not upload the whole project as it will cause data privacy issues, i have showcased this small case study having open source data available to everyone for research and study purpose. Hope this case study shows a snippet of my experience and knowledge.
