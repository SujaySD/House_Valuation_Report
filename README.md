This case study on house valuation prices only scratched the surface of a complex topic. I along with a team had done a detailed project and dugged deeper into the factors that influence house prices, such as location, Roof area by categorizing into Tiers, and Roofing Type etc.
Our research team had compiled a vast array of data from various sources, including real estate agencies, government reports, and academic studies. We have analyzed this data using advanced statistical methods and visualization tools to provide insights that are both accurate and engaging. Whether you are a roofing agency, roofing insurance company, real estate agent, or simply curious about the housing market, these slides will broaden your knowledge and challenge your assumptions. I can not upload the whole project as it will cause data privacy issues, i have showcased this small case study having open source data available to everyone for research and study purpose. Hope this case study shows a snippet of my experience and knowledge.
